Once I saw a photograph of a place in Madrid, nothing special, a normal street in the center. 
But I had been in that street before, many times, and I just couldn't remember which street that was. 
Annoyed, I felt the need to find out. And at the same time, learn a little bit of python.

In the photo I could see a pharmacy and a tobacconist shop next to each other.
Both types of establishments needed a license from the region, 
and they have to be registered on a public list, so anyone can have access to that information. 
After a few minutes I could find both files:
https://www.comunidad.madrid/sites/default/files/doc/sanidad/orde/oficinas_de_farmacia_abiertas.08062020.pdf
https://www.crtm.es/media/239997/estancosttp_comunidad_de_madrid.pdf

However, after some problems with the tobacco shops list 
(extracting data from pdf using python is somehow very delicate, and not always works)
I had to obtain the data in another format. 
Luckily, I could download a csv file directly from:
https://datos.crtm.es/datasets/ptosventa-logista/data

Once the postal codes and addresses of all pharmacies and tobacconist shops 
in the center of Madrid (postal codes below 28020) were extracted, 
The I found the streets that hosted both. 
In addition, the difference in their numbers should be exactly 2, 
as in the photo they appear to be next to each other. 

The code generates a csv file with a list of addresses where 
a pharmacy can be found next to a tobacconist shop. 
Then it was a matter of checking the handful of places "by hand", 
and in no time I could find out where the place was.
